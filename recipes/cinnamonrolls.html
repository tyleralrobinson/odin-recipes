            <li>For the filling, whisk 1/4 cup of white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Sprinkle 1 tbsp. of the cinnamon-sugar mixture in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle remaining cinnamon sugar over butter-brushed dough.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough around filling to form a log; cut the log into 9 rolls about 1-inch wide; place rolls cut-side up in the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, they'll be done once the rolls are puffed and lightly golden.</li>
